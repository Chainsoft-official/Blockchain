EVM Blockchain provides a comprehensive, easy-to-use interface for users to view, confirm, and inspect transactions on EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) blockchains. This includes Ethereum Mainnet, Ethereum Classic, Optimism, Gnosis Chain, and many other **Ethereum testnets, private networks, L2s, and sidechains**.

## About EVM Blockchain

EVM Blockchain allows users to search transactions, view accounts and balances, verify and interact with smart contracts, and view and interact with applications on the Ethereum network including many forks, sidechains, L2s, and testnets.

Blockscout is an open-source alternative to centralized, closed-source block explorers such as Etherscan, Etherchain, and others. As Ethereum sidechains and L2s continue to proliferate in both private and public settings, transparent, open-source tools are needed to analyze and validate all transactions.

## Features

- **Transaction Search**: Easily search for transactions by hash, block number, or address.
- **Account and Balance Viewing**: View detailed information about accounts and their balances.
- **Smart Contract Verification**: Verify the source code of smart contracts and interact with them directly from the explorer.
- **Network Support**: Supports Ethereum Mainnet, testnets, private networks, L2s, sidechains, and many other EVM-compatible chains.
- **Open Source**: Fully open-source project licensed under GPL v3.0 and MIT.
- **Extensive Integration**: Integrates with several hundred chains and rollups across the blockchain ecosystem, including Ethereum, Cosmos, Polkadot, Avalanche, and Near.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, intuitive interface for seamless navigation and interaction.

## Supported Projects

Blockscout currently supports several hundred chains and rollups throughout the greater blockchain ecosystem.
